# Zoomer
Zoomer is application for zooming on Windows. It is my adaptation of [boomer](https://github.com/tsoding/boomer) - application that was made by [Tsoding](https://www.twitch.tv/tsoding)(cool guy btw) for Linux.

# Quick Start
```console
$ cargo run
```
Also you will need a C compiler (like gcc, clang, or MS's own compiler) to rust compiler can build sdl2 library.
